# 8051_Serial_Communications
Code for illustrating serial communiations between 8051 microcontroller (mcu) and the Hyper-Terminal of you personal computer is given.
Download the code unzip it and open the project with Kei uVision. Build it and produce the .hex file. Upload the .hex file to the 8051 mcu. 
Complete the circuit according Circuit.png image. Be careful to join 8051 to the computer through DB9 connector via Max232 chip. This chip converts the RS232 level of your computer to the ttl (transistor - transistor level) of your microcontroller (mcu).
After powering 8051 mcu open the hyper-terminal of your personal computer. First, instructions sent from 8051 will be displayed on the hyper-terminal. Give input according to the instrucion from your hyper-terminal, the mcu will respond accordingly.
